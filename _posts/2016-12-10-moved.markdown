I have moved my blog from zotskolf.nl to here (=kasterma.net).  As I did not
want to put a lot of effort into this move, the articles that now looked
uninteresting to me or had no longer existing references have been dropped.

The syntax coloring in the older posts currently doesn't work; once I figure
it out for a new post I may go back and fix it up though this has to be
considered not very likely.
