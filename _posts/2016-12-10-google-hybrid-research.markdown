Notes on the [article](http://norvig.com/hybrid-research.pdf) by Spector,
Norvig, and Petrov on the way google organizes the combination of engineering
and research.

- empirical component of CS research is in upswing.  But CS in general is
  expanding.  Methods of dissemination is evolving, from only papers, to e.g.
  open source releases.

- goal of research is to bring significant, practical benefits to the users, and
  to do so rapidly.

- research and development are closely integrated, in fact line between the
  two is very blurred.

  There are research teams where the emphasis is more on research, but the
  distinction is one of emphasis.  People and teams can move between the two.
  This integration minimizes or eliminates the issues with transfer from
  research to implementation.

  Long term research is factorized into smaller steps (where possible; there are
  things where long term is essential, but these are the exception).

  Iterative approach; avoiding elaborate prototypes, immediately going into
  production where possible.  Teams move with product from research to
  production.

- aspects at google that support this:
  - there is a rich set of computing abstractions and resources available for
    universal use at google
  - the services based model make this all at everyones disposal
  - the teams across the organization consist of talented individuals

- being part of research community reduces the probability of being blindsided
  by developments.

- risk of the integration is that there is not enough openness for academic
  developments; mitigate this by very open exchange with academic community.
