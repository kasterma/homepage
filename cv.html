<blockquote>
In 2012 I left a position as an Assistant Professor in Mathematics at the
University of Colorado giving in to a longstanding interest in information
technology.  Since then I have been working as a software developer and data
scientist.  <!--I am interested in a position with a great team solving
challenging practical problems.-->

  Short Research Description
</h2>

<p>
In <emph>The Complexity of Maximal Cofinitary Groups</emph> I study how simple
certain algebraic objects can be.  I prove that a standard
construction of a Turing machine (computer program) is impossible, but
that a Turing machine that gets an additional input as a hint can
complete the construction.
</p>

<p>
In <emph>Comparing Notions of Randomness</emph> we study formalizations of
effective randomness.  These formalizations are analogous to
definitions of pseudo random generator, replacing polynomial time
computable by computable.
</p>

<p>
In <emph>An Example of a Cofinitary Group in Isabelle/HOL</emph> I formalize a
construction of a group.  That is, I take the usual proof as given,
and using the Isabelle/HOL system formalize it into a proof that has
been checked by computer.
