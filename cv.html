These academic positions had research in mathematical logic (set
theory and computability theory) as the main component.  They also
involved teaching a variety of classes at both undergraduate and
graduate levels, and administration (including organizing
conferences).

  Short Research Description
</h2>

<p>
In <emph>The Complexity of Maximal Cofinitary Groups</emph> I study how simple
certain algebraic objects can be.  I prove that a standard
construction of a Turing machine (computer program) is impossible, but
that a Turing machine that gets an additional input as a hint can
complete the construction.
</p>

<p>
In <emph>Comparing Notions of Randomness</emph> we study formalizations of
effective randomness.  These formalizations are analogous to
definitions of pseudo random generator, replacing polynomial time
computable by computable.
</p>

<p>
In <emph>An Example of a Cofinitary Group in Isabelle/HOL</emph> I formalize a
construction of a group.  That is, I take the usual proof as given,
and using the Isabelle/HOL system formalize it into a proof that has
been checked by computer.
