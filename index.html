     I am Bart Kastermans, currently a data scientist at <a href="http://www.adgoji.com">ADGOJI</a> in
     Amsterdam, the Netherlands.
   </p>

   <p>
     In 2006 I received a PhD in Mathematics at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.  After that I was a postdoc at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and then an Assistant Professor at the University of Colorado, Boulder.
     </p>

     <p>
    My mathematical work has been in Set Theory (almost disjoint type
    families) and Computability theory (effective randomness and
    reverse mathematics).
