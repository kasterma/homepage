   <h1>Bart Kastermans' Home Page</h1>

   <p>
     Bart Kastermans is a software engineer and data scientist based
     in the Netherlands (working in Amsterdam area, living in
     Uitgeest).  In 2012 he made the switch from an academic position
     (Mathematics) to a position in IT.  Since then he has developed
     into the tech lead of the team that is building a streaming data
     engine based on kafka and flink running on kubernetes at KPN.
     Next to building the team, and with that team selecting/designing
     the architecture, it means doing the engineering.  As some
     examples this invovled writing flink jobs (scala), working on
     logging and monitoring, configuring components to use SSL, making
     design choices to ensure manageability of the cluster, writing
     parts of the custom build components (java), generic cluster
     management (bash, python), ensuring customer privacy is respected
     and the privacy policies are followed.

     He is currently doing the Udacity nanodegree on Deep
     Reinforcement Learning.  Reading the book Introduction to
     Cryptography by Katz and Lindell.  And learning to use wireshark
     better to check that the security settings in the streaming
     engine do indeed have the desired effects (of encrypting the
     inter pod traffic).  Also he is learning to sail in his jeanneau
     sun 2000 sailboat.

   <p>
     Having been at the current position for about three years he is
     starting to look for new opportunities.  Next to data science and
     data engineering he is very interested in security and
     cryptography; which he would enjoy to be part of a new challenge.
     Team leading or management are neither his strong points, nor his
     interest.  It is a technical position he is interested in.

   <p>
     At the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, he wrote a thesis in
     Set Theory titled Cofinitary Groups and Other Almost Disjoint
     Families under supervision of Andreas Blass and Yi Zhang.  During
     the writing he visited Yi Zhang at Sun-Yat Sen University in
     China for a year.

     After getting a PhD he worked as a postdoc at the Mathmatics
     department of the University of Wisconsin, Madison, for three
     years.  During this time he worked with Steffen Lempp, resulting
     in a couple of papers among which is the paper on Comparing
     Notions of Randomness.  He then moved on to be an Assistant
     Professor at the Mathematics department of the University of
     Colorado, Boulder, for three years.  This was a tenure-track
     position, but after those three years he decided to give in to a
     long standing interest in information technology.
