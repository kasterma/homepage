     About this blog
   </h2>
   <p>
     I started this part of my website on April 4, 2013.  The plan is
     to have something bloglike where I can write some experiences
     with programming and related matters.  The subtitle "an
     additional opportunity to be hopelessly wrong" is to be taken as
     serious as possible.  Some things written here will have been
     thought about deeply, others have been barely thought about long
     enough to touch the keyboard to make them appear here.

    Btw: <a href="http://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zotskolf">Zotskolf</a> is
    the Dutch word for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marotte">
    Marotte</a>, a fool's sceptre.
