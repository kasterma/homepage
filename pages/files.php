      <i>Abstract:</i>
      We study two different types of (maximal) almost disjoint
      families: very mad families and (maximal) cofinitary groups. For
      the very mad families we prove the basic existence results. We
      prove that MA implies there exist many pairwise orthogonal
      families, and that CH implies that for any very mad family there
      is one orthogonal to it. Finally we prove that the axiom of
      constructibility implies that there exists a coanalytic very mad
      family. <br />

      Cofinitary groups have a natural action on the natural
      numbers. We prove that a maximal cofinitary group cannot have
      infinitely many orbits under this action, but can have any
      combination of any finite number of finite orbits and any finite
      (but nonzero) number of infinite orbits. <br />

      We also prove that there exists a maximal cofinitary group into
      which each countable group embeds. This gives an example of a
      maximal cofinitary group that is not a free group. We start the
      investigation into which groups have cofinitary actions. The
      main result there is that it is consistent that the direct sum
      of &aleph;<sub>1</sub> many copies of Z<sub>2</sub> has a
      cofinitary action. <br />

      Concerning the complexity of maximal cofinitary groups we prove
      that they cannot be K<sub>&sigma;</sub>, but that the axiom of
      constructibility implies that there exists a coanalytic maximal
      cofinitary group. We prove that the least cardinality
      a<sub>g</sub> of a maximal cofinitary group can consistently be
      less than the cofinality of the symmetric group. <br />

      Finally we prove that a<sub>g</sub> can consistently be bigger
      than all cardinals in Cichon's diagram.

      We consider the possible cardinalities of the following three
      cardinal invariants which are related to the permutation group
      on the set of natural numbers: <br />

      a<sub>g</sub> := the least cardinal number of maximal cofinitary
      permutation groups; <br />

      a<sub>p</sub> := the least cardinal number of maximal almost disjoint
      permutation families; <br />

      c(Sym(N)) := the cofinality of the permutation group
      on the set of natural numbers. <br />

      We show that it is consistent with ZFC that a<sub>p</sub> =
      a<sub>g</sub> &lt; c(Sym(N)) = 2; in fact we show that in the

      A cofinitary group is a subgroup of the infinite symmetric group
      in which each element of the subgroup has at most finitely many

      that is maximal with respect to inclusion. We investigate the

      Hirschfeldt and Shore have introduced a notion of stability for
      infinite posets. We define an arguably more natural notion
      called weak stability, and we study the existence of infinite
      computable or low chains or antichains, and of infinite
      &Pi;<sup>0</sup><sub>1</sub>-chains and antichains, in infinite
      computable stable and weakly stable posets.  For example, we
      extend a result of Hirschfeldt and Shore to show that every
      infinite computable weakly stable poset contains either an
      infinite low chain or an infinite computable antichain. Our
      hardest result is that there is an infinite computable weakly
      stable poset with no infinite
      &Pi;<sup>0</sup><sub>1</sub>-chains or antichains. On the other
      hand, it is easily seen that every infinite computable stable
      poset contains an infinite computable chain or an infinite
      &Pi;<sup>0</sup><sub>1</sub>-antichain.  In Reverse Mathematics,
      we show that SCAC, the principle that every infinite stable
      poset contains an infinite chain or antichain, is equivalent
      over RCA<sub>0</sub> to WSCAC, the corresponding principle for
      weakly stable posets.

       cofinitary group is a cofinitary group, maximal with respect to
